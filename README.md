## Why it exists

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **OpenAI exposed Standard and Extended thinking in GPT-5.5 Pro. GPT-5.6 Pro hides that choice; this extension brings it back.**

This dependency-free Manifest V3 extension adds a compact **Standard / Extended** selector beside ChatGPT's visible **Pro** or **GPT-5.6 Pro** model control. It does not replace ChatGPT's model menu.

> [!WARNING]
> This unofficial extension uses Chrome's powerful `debugger` permission. Review the source before installing it. ChatGPT or Chrome changes can break it without notice.

## Install with Codex 5.6 Sol

Copy the block below and paste it into Codex 5.6 Sol:

~~~text
Download or safely update the ChatGPT Pro Effort Selector from:
https://github.com/ahmedelami/chatgpt-pro-effort-selector

Work autonomously until it is installed and visibly verified in Google Chrome.

1. Read the repository README, `manifest.json`, and relevant source before installing. Explain that this unpacked extension requests Chrome's powerful debugger permission because Extended mode briefly intercepts one ChatGPT request at a time.
2. Use Git or the terminal to clone the repository into the stable local directory `~/chatgpt-pro-effort-selector`.
   - If that directory is absent, clone the repository's default branch there.
   - If it exists, verify it is a Git clone of exactly this repository. Never overwrite, delete, reset, or repurpose an unrelated directory.
   - If the correct clone is clean and on its default branch, fetch and update it with a fast-forward-only pull.
   - If it is dirty, diverged, on another branch, or has a different remote, stop and report the issue without modifying it.
3. From the repository root, run `npm run validate`. Do not run `npm install`; there are no dependencies or build steps. Stop and report any validation failure.
4. Use Computer Use for all Chrome UI actions. Do not use DevTools, Protocol Monitor, CDP, or a browser-control plugin that attaches a debugger to the ChatGPT tab.
5. Open `chrome://extensions`, enable Developer mode, and find ChatGPT Pro Effort Selector.
   - If this same clone is already loaded, click Reload.
   - If a copy from another directory or multiple copies exist, stop and ask me. Do not remove anything or load a duplicate.
   - Otherwise, click Load unpacked and choose the clone directory containing `manifest.json`.
6. If this is a first-time Load unpacked install, wait until immediately before clicking Load unpacked, then explain the debugger-permission risk and ask for the single action-time confirmation required by Computer Use. Batch that one confirmation to cover clicking Load unpacked, choosing exactly the verified `~/chatgpt-pro-effort-selector` directory containing `manifest.json`, and accepting only Chrome's expected debugger-related warning for this extension. After I confirm, continue autonomously without another confirmation. If the same clone is already loaded and only needs Reload, do not ask for confirmation.
7. Open or reload `https://chatgpt.com/`. Without sending a message, select the visible Pro model if needed and verify that a compact selector containing exactly Standard and Extended appears beside it.
8. Confirm Chrome's installed extension version matches `manifest.json`.
9. Do not send a ChatGPT message unless I explicitly ask for a live request test. If I do request one, keep DevTools and every other debugger-based browser tool detached during the Extended send because the extension needs exclusive temporary debugger access.
10. Report the clone path, extension version, validation result, and visible Chrome verification. Leave ChatGPT open and leave the current test chat in Standard mode.

## Use it

1. Select **Pro** in ChatGPT.
2. Choose **Standard** or **Extended**.
3. Send normally with the composer button or Enter.

### Standard

- It is the safe default.
- ChatGPT requests remain untouched.
- The debugger is not attached.

### Extended

- The extension briefly attaches immediately before a normal Pro composer send.
- It matches one fresh Pro request, changes its effort to Extended, clears interception, and detaches.
- Extended stays selected for that conversation until you switch it back.

Saved conversations keep independent modes and matching tabs stay synchronized. Blank drafts keep a tab-local mode until they become saved conversations. The selector is hidden for GPT-5.6 Sol and does not cover regenerate, retry, branch, or other non-composer actions.

Keep DevTools, Protocol Monitor, and other debugger-based tools detached during an Extended send. If the extension cannot safely prove the expected request lifecycle, it blocks or reports an uncertain outcome instead of silently claiming Extended succeeded.

## Safety and privacy

| Access | Why it is needed |
| --- | --- |
| `https://chatgpt.com/*` | Runs the selector only on ChatGPT |
| `debugger` | Briefly intercepts one Extended send |
| `storage` | Saves per-chat modes and redacted session state |
| `webNavigation` | Keeps an operation bound to the correct conversation |

- No telemetry or remote code.
- Prompts, responses, cookies, authorization values, and header values are not retained.
- The full request body is parsed transiently and never retained; browser-session storage keeps only redacted audit fields and the minimal operational identifiers described in the technical reference.
- The debugger is attached only for an Extended send and detached as quickly as the one-shot lifecycle permits.

See the [technical reference](docs/technical-reference.md) for the complete permission, redacted-audit, and recovery design.

## Manual installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ~~~bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedelami/chatgpt-pro-effort-selector.git
   cd chatgpt-pro-effort-selector
   ~~~

2. Open `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked**.
5. Choose the cloned repository root containing `manifest.json`.
6. Accept Chrome's debugger-related warning.
7. Open or reload [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/).

No build step or package installation is required. Do not run `npm install`.

## Validate

Requires Node.js 18 or newer:

~~~bash
npm run validate
~~~

This checks every extension script and runs the complete automated test suite.

Create the deterministic Chrome Web Store upload ZIP with:

~~~bash
npm run package
~~~

The archive is written to `dist/` with `manifest.json` at its root.

## Technical documentation

- [Technical reference](docs/technical-reference.md) — storage, request lifecycle, navigation, recovery, permissions, privacy, and project structure.
- [Manual QA checklist](docs/manual-qa.md) — full browser, accessibility, mode, persistence, and failure test matrix.
- [Privacy policy](PRIVACY.md) — public disclosure of local processing, retained state, and user control.
- [Chrome Web Store listing](docs/store-listing.md) — listing copy, permission justifications, upload assets, and reviewer instructions.

## Known limitations

- The extension depends on unsupported ChatGPT DOM and request internals.
- ChatGPT or Chrome changes can break it.
- Shadow DOM isolates the selector's internal styling, but not model detection, mount-point discovery, or request schemas.
- The extension intentionally blocks Extended or reports an uncertain outcome when required structure no longer matches.
